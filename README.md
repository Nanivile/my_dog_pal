# MyDogPal
The dog assistant app of the future. MyDogPal strives to help owners improve the quality of life for their K-9 friends. With our mission statement in mind, we want our users to have an account in witch they could add/remove a list of dogs from their profile. Users can also track their dogs nutrition via the food they eat and what the proper amount of food their dog should eat given their age and weight. Finally, users will have access to their dogs medical history and information on the nearest veterinarian office in case of in emergency. Lets create the best life for our pals with MyDogPal
